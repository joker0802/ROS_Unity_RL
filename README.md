# ROS_Unity_RL

create a new unity project and download these asset and project setting to it.

the video transmission problem is not solved, so we can just use low resolution for now.

if you don't like the scene, you could dissable the vienna model and build you own road with the model under Assets\Free_Models\LowpolyStreetPack\Prefabs\Roads

if there is any problem, pls let me know
